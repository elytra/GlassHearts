## Notice: Glass Hearts is currently unmaintained.

*A novel and balanced way to increase your health.*

**This mod is open source and under a permissive license.** All Elytra mods are,
and as such, can be included in any modpack on any platform without prior
permission. We appreciate hearing about people using our mods, but you do not
need to ask to use them. See the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for more details.

Glass Hearts adds five things:

 * An enchantment, called Sapping
 * A fluid, called Lifeforce
 * A block, called a Glass Heart
 * A few gems, to supplement the ones in vanilla
 * A completely overhauled health bar renderer, with sub-half-heart accuracy

Sapping allows you to fill bottles with Lifeforce by killing mobs. By default,
you cannot gain Lifeforce from undead mobs, and there's a config option to only
allow getting it from players.

Glass Hearts allow you to increase your max health, *but don't refill on their
own*. You can adorn these hearts with 1 gem to give special effects, dependent
on the gem.

Automated piping can refill Glass Hearts, but only so fast. In addition,
multiple players can share a Glass Heart.

But beware; Glass Hearts are targetted by creepers (configurable), and can be
difficult to refill! In a PvP setting, enemy players might break it instead!

Glass Hearts do not chunkload and instead store their data out-of-band in a
global map. This means you can utilize a Glass Heart in an unloaded chunk
without worrying about it, unless you have an automated refill system.

Not even Regeneration will work on a Glass Heart, nor healing offered by other
mods.

This mod idea was originally intended for a factions PvP server, but I'm
releasing it as an open-source Forge mod because I can't just continue to not
implement this idea. I hope you enjoy!
